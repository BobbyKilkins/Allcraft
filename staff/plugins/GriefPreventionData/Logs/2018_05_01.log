19:44 TheJavaDev    : hi
19:44 AirFusion_45  : the rcon still dont work
19:44 TheJavaDev    : yes i know :(
19:45 AirFusion_45  : its fine
19:45 AirFusion_45  : no rush setting up thou
19:45 TheJavaDev    : theres a bigger prob right now
19:45 TheJavaDev    : so the modded servers are for 1.7.10
19:45 AirFusion_45  : uh
19:45 TheJavaDev    : and bungeecord is 1.8 up
19:45 AirFusion_45  : cant we have a world just on 1.7?
19:46 AirFusion_45  : i know servers do that
19:46 TheJavaDev    : so like separate servers?
19:46 AirFusion_45  : yes
19:46 TheJavaDev    : well that would mean like totally separate servers
19:47 AirFusion_45  : no
19:47 TheJavaDev    : but bungeecord is 1.8 up
19:47 AirFusion_45  : like can we have one world on 1.7.10?
19:47 AirFusion_45  : oh
19:47 AirFusion_45  : any 1.8 mods?
19:47 AirFusion_45  : than
19:47 TheJavaDev    : so im trying to find either modded server for 1.8, or how to make bungeecord work for 1.7.10
19:47 AirFusion_45  : uh i am pretty sure its possible
19:48 TheJavaDev    : yes
19:48 TheJavaDev    : maybe
19:48 TheJavaDev    : i hope
19:48 AirFusion_45  : i've seen other servers do it that way
19:49 TheJavaDev    : like 1.7.10 world connected by bungeecord?
19:49 AirFusion_45  : no
19:49 AirFusion_45  : 1.8 mods
19:49 AirFusion_45  : world
19:49 TheJavaDev    : oh
19:49 TheJavaDev    : well yes there are some 1.8 mods
19:49 AirFusion_45  : yes
19:49 AirFusion_45  : wait
19:50 TheJavaDev    : but cauldron is 1.7.10
19:50 AirFusion_45  : can we try older versions of bungeecord?
19:51 TheJavaDev    : i may have found a solution
19:51 AirFusion_45  : ok
19:51 AirFusion_45  : what?
19:52 TheJavaDev    : so theres this thingy called hexacord thats supposed to support bungeecord for 1.7.10
19:52 TheJavaDev    : ill try it out
19:52 AirFusion_45  : ok
19:52 AirFusion_45  : i have seen hexacord
19:52 TheJavaDev    : my clouds are glitched for some reason

20:02 TheJavaDev    : well
20:02 AirFusion_45  : yes?
20:02 TheJavaDev    : theres no info on hexacord though
20:03 AirFusion_45  : :/ that helps lol
20:03 TheJavaDev    : like no vids or even a project page on spigot or anything
20:03 TheJavaDev    : theres just a jar called hexacord and it says bungeecord for 1.7.10-1.12.2 in description
20:03 TheJavaDev    : i guess ill try dumping it in some plugins folders and running it or something
20:04 AirFusion_45  : ok
20:06 AirFusion_45  : anything?
20:06 AirFusion_45  : restart?
20:06 TheJavaDev    : /msg AirFusion_45 so it looks like its like a replacement for the bungeecord server completely 
20:06 AirFusion_45  : /r oh 
20:06 AirFusion_45  : /r does it have the things that bungeecord has? 
20:07 TheJavaDev    : /r it seems it just uses bungeecords configs :/ and just replaces the jars 
20:07 AirFusion_45  : /r oh 
20:07 TheJavaDev    : /r so should i restart and test it right now? they are afk enyways 
20:07 AirFusion_45  : /r yes 
20:07 TheJavaDev    : /r 
20:07 TheJavaDev    : /r k 
20:08 TheJavaDev    : /r so like after some time, try joining with a forge 1.7.10 client if you dont have it, its really easy to install 
20:08 TheJavaDev    : /r keep in touch on discord 
20:08 AirFusion_45  : /r ok
