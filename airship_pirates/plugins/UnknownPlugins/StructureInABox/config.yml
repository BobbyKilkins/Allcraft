# Turning off "free-space-check" will allow users to overwrite
# blocks such as chests and obsidian. It is strongly recommended to leave it on.
# When it's on, you also need to specify the blocks to check against: If
# "check-all-solid-blocks" is set to "yes", the plugin will check against
# all solid blocks. If it's set to "no", the plugin will only check against
# the list under "check-just-specific-blocks".
#
# Both "check-all-solid-blocks" and "check-just-specific-blocks" have no effect
# if free-space-check is set to "no".
