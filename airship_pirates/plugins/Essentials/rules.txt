IGNORANCE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AS AN EXCUSE!

Pollution / Ugliness
 - Don't frivolously or excessively damage the terrain.
 - If you use a pillar, clean it up when you are done.
 - Modifications to real estate you purchase in the cities or the wilds should be tasteful, in fitting with the storyline, and not intentionally offensive.
 - Some kinds of pollution are inevitable, like some floating wreckage being left over after a crash. You will not be punished for this, but do clean it up when you can.

Protected Airspace
 - Do not Obstruct Traffic. This means do not leave your airhsip parked at a dock for an extended period.
 - Protected Airspace is meant to be just that, protected. Do not attack, harm, harrass or otherwise "go after" another player in protected airspace.
 - Do not abuse Minecraft glitches, hacks, or loopholes.
 - Any blocks of any kind placed in Protected Airspace should be removed when you are done with them.

Client side mods
 - Minimap mods are allowed (and highly recommended).
 - Schematic building plugins may be used for reference only, not by automating the build itself.
 - Any kind of flying hack or any other client side software that grants you special in-game abilities that a default client would not have is hacking and will get you permanently banned immediately and with no questions asked.

Language
 - PG-13 language - No sexually explicit profanity. Limit other forms of profanity.

Ship Construction Rules
 - Veteran status is required to place Airship and Cruise signs
 - Redstone engines must be contiguous and exposed at the back of your ship, or in pods sticking out from the side
 - No invulnerable armor
 - Cruise signs can only face forwards
